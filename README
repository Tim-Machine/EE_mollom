How it works

Currently Mollom for Expression engine will check all comments using the hook " ". If a comment is flagged as spam it will automatically be closed, if the system is unsure it will become a pending comment, if its not spam or penning the comment will be posted.

This is complete automation.


**Future**
working on a second part to track then number of comments that have been tracked and how many post fall into each category of spam, ham or unsure.
